# Used Car Price Prediction & Deployment Project

For this project, I use statistical analysis and visualization tools to assess different features that influence used car prices. I then run 5 different regression models to predict used car prices. Lastly, inside the "Deployment App" folder, you can find a Flask Application where I deployed my highest scoring model with a small interface for users to value the price of their cars (euros).
